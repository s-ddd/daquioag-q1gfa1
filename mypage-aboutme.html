    <h1><u><i>About Me</u></i></h1>
    <hr>
    My name is Walter Hartwell Whi- I mean Sam Jacob D. Daquioag. I am a Grade 9 Pisay scholar from section Lithium. This is my About Me.
    Jokes aside I am a video game addict that mostly plays on mobile devices. I am also learning how to create my own games and making things in a 3d model program called Blender.
    Because of the internet, my humor became worse and it's so bad now that I would laugh at a piece of bread falling off the kitchen counter.
    I am also the kind of person who would rather be alone than being with other people including friends.
    Anyway that's pretty much it I guess?? Thanks for listening.
